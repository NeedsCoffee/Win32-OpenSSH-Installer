# Win32-OpenSSH-Installer

What started as a basic github release retrieval tool has turned into a rather targetted Win32-OpenSSH-Installer script.

Just run in powershell, either by right-clicking or by using .\Win32-OpenSSH-Installer.ps1

The script will self-elevate if needed, download the latest release, and then install that release by extracting it.
